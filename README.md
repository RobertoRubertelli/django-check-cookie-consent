# Django Cookie Consent with django-allauth and cookiechoises.js
[link to Git-Hub source files](https://github.com/RobertoRubertelli/django-htmx-check-os)

####
GDPR law is an important subject to respect.
I have to be sure the visitor accepted the cookie before the Sign Up and the Log In.
I'm using the cookiechoices.js library. It is the google help for this subject.
I'm adding 3 django functions in the pages app, to finish the js library job.
